# Horizontal rules for each line are centred on the baseline of your
# font at position 0. It is not necessary to actually rule a line
# at 0 though. You MUST, however, have rules to mark the extent of
# ascenders and descenders as they are used to establish the total
# height of a line. It is not required that they are actually visible,
# just that they are specified.
# If you want ascenders to have some overlap with descenders on the
# previous line you should do that with a negative gap rather than
# using false top and bottom rules.
